# _jhcha_.blog(\*)

This is my home where all my texts will be living in. I will be posting (hopefully) lots of dev-related posts, but it is not just a dev blog meaning that I will write things that aren't directly related to programming. The primary purpose of making this blog is to have a place where I can archive my own writings and to share with others.

## Dev stack

I am building this using the following libraries / frameworks

- Astro
- Tailwindcss

Astro is a static site builder which aims to send 0kb javascript to the client side. It has its own syntax that is similar to `jsx` and handles routing out of the box. The project is in beta as of now, but it is growing fast everyday! If this sounds intereting, check the [documentation](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro).

Tailwindcss is my favorite utility based `CSS` framework. My favorite part of Tailwindcss is that it cuts out all the concerns about naming the classes in `HTML`.

## WIP

I like to mess around with all the design choices I have and because of that, the progress is kinda slow. ðŸ™ƒ There are plenty of things to be added and improved.

### TODO
