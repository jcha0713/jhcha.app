This is my home where all my texts will be living in. I will be posting (hopefully) lots of dev-related posts, but it is not just a dev blog meaning that I will write things that aren't directly related to programming. The primary purpose of making this blog is to have a place where I can archive my own writings and to share with others.

## WIP

I like to mess around with all the design choices I have and because of that, the progress is kinda slow. ðŸ™ƒ There are plenty of things to be added and improved.
