[![Built with Astro](https://astro.badg.es/v1/built-with-astro.svg)](https://astro.build)

This is my home where all my texts will be living in. I will be posting (hopefully) lots of dev-related posts, but it is not just a dev blog meaning that I will write things that aren't directly related to programming. The primary purpose of making this blog is to have a place where I can archive my own writings and to share with others.

## Dev stack

I am building this using the following libraries / frameworks

- Astro
  - XElement
  - astro-icon
  - astro-seo
- Tailwindcss

Astro is a static site builder which aims to send 0kb javascript to the client side. It has its own syntax that is similar to `jsx` and handles the routing work out of the box. The project is in beta as of now, but it is growing fast! If this sounds intereting, check the [documentation](https://docs.astro.build/).

Tailwindcss is my favorite utility based `CSS` framework. The best part of Tailwindcss is that it cuts out all the concerns about naming the classes in `HTML`.

## WIP
